# Contributing to nicebucket

Thanks for wanting to contribute to nicebucket!

## Project Status

This project is still pretty early stage and we're figuring out where we want to take it. We decide which PRs to merge based on what fits our current direction, regardless of how good the code is.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Quality

- All CI checks need to pass (linting, formatting, tests, builds)
- Follow the existing code style
- Make sure you can explain your code in case we have questions

### AI-Generated Code

We don't care if you use AI tools - we can't tell anyway. Just be ready to explain your code if we ask.

### Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo and make a feature branch
2. Make your changes and ensure checks pass
3. Submit a PR with a clear description
4. Be ready to discuss your changes

We appreciate contributions but reserve the right to decline PRs that don't fit our current priorities.
