# Roadmap

Here's what we're planning to work on next. These are our current priorities but things change as we learn more about what users actually need.

* [ ] Drag and drop file uploads and organization
* [ ] Distribution via package managers (Homebrew, AUR, etc.)
* [ ] Improved keyboard navigation with arrow keys and shortcuts
* [ ] Command palette for quick actions (Cmd/Ctrl+K)
* [ ] Vim motions support
* [ ] Creating and deleting buckets
* [ ] Proper file tree with expanding/collapsing nodes
* [ ] E2E test setup with testcontainers
